# CS356-Final-Project

In this project, we captured and studied over 30,000 unique HTTP requests sent out to servers while using the top 100 Android apps. 

We narrowed our list down to 77 apps in order to focus our study on apps that contain user-generated data.

The goal of this project is to determine how common it is for applications to send requests to foreign servers (i.e. non-American servers) and to analyze exactly what kind of data is being exchanged with these servers.
